    "A modo de finalización de este trabajo, haremos un pequeño repaso sobre todos los puntos que analizamos y sus respectivos resultados y/o observaciones hechos por nosotros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sobre el análisis realizado en el apartado de **procesamiento del lenguaje natural**, y en particular haciendo referencia a las métricas que obtuvimos luego del entrenamiento y predicción con el dataset producto de la ampliación, utilizando el modelo XGBoost, pudimos observar que si bien aún las métricas no nos resultan del todo satisfactorias cumplen con el objetivo de mejorar las resultantes del trabajo anterior. Más allá de que la cantidad de aciertos continúa sin incrementar, tanto el error MSE como el RMSE decrecieron ofreciendo mejores resultados. Por otro lado, el coeficiente de determinación se incrementó notoriamente llegando casi a un 0.9%. \n",
    "\n",
    "En cuanto a lo referido sobre **redes neuronales**, la comparación será directamente en base a los nuevos modelos ya que el dataset utilizado es compartido en ambos trabajos. Dicho esto, el error cometido en el modelo de regresión es significativamente pequeño. Teniendo en cuenta los resultantes del TP1, si utilizamos el menor luego de que éstos tuvieron su optimización de parámetros correspondiente, notamos que el que mejor performa es XGBoost con un MSE de 51650994876 (al cual de todas formas le atribuímos arrastre de error en nuestro planteo). Utilizando redes neuronales cometemos tan solo un error cuadrático medio equivalente a 1.36. Por otro lado, en lo que respecta al modelo de clasificación, obtuvimos resultados bastante similares. Si bien tanto el accuracy, precisión y F1-Score dieron distintos, la diferencia es de tan solo uno/dos puntos. Con esto concluimos que para clasificación no se notan mejoras por sobre los modelos utilizados en el trabajo anterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Como último requerimiento se pidió estudiar las métricas tanto para regresión como clasificación pero haciendo uso de **ensambles**, en particular de tipo híbridos. En lo que respecta al utilizado para clasificación (Voting) obtuvimos mejores resultados para las métricas de Accuracy, Recall y F1-Score. Sin embargo, aunque en Precisión disminuyó un poco, esta diferencia continúa siendo no significativa. Pasando al ensamble de regresión (Stacking) el MSE resultante que obtuvimos fue 238481755830. Creemos que nuevamente estamos cometiendo involuntariamente algún arrastre de error en alguno de los incisos desarrollados, ya que este error es incluso mayor a los cometidos en los modelos individuales desarrollados en el TP1, y no estaría respetando la regla principal de ‘*La sabiduría de las multitudes*’."
